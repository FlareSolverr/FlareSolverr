## v2.0.0 (2021/10/20)

FlareSolverr 2.0.0 is out with some important changes:

* It is capable of solving the automatic challenges of Cloudflare. CAPTCHAs (hCaptcha) cannot be resolved and the old solvers have been removed.
* The Chrome browser has been replaced by Firefox. This has caused some functionality to be removed. Parameters: `userAgent`, `headers`, `rawHtml` and `downloadare` no longer available.
* Included `proxy` support without user/password credentials. If you are writing your own integration with FlareSolverr, make sure your client uses the same User-Agent header and Proxy that FlareSolverr uses. Those values together with the Cookie are checked and detected by Cloudflare.
* FlareSolverr has been rewritten from scratch. From now on it should be easier to maintain and test.
* If you are using Jackett make sure you have version v0.18.1041 or higher. FlareSolverSharp v2.0.0 is out too.
